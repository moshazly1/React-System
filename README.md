# Professional Login System Project

This project aims to build a comprehensive login system using **React**, showcasing a variety of essential techniques and concepts for modern web application development. Here's an overview of what the project covers:

### Key Features:
- **Working with React Hooks**: A practical demonstration of using `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for handling side effects and data interactions.
- **Routing Control**: Learn about routing concepts in React using `React Router`, including:
  - Creating internal routes.
  - Handling nested routes.
  - Protecting routes using **tokens** to restrict access to specific pages unless the user is logged in.
- **API Integration**:
  - Sending and receiving data using **Axios**.
  - Performing essential operations like `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` to interact with the backend.
- **Handling Tokens and Refresh Tokens**:
  - Using **tokens** to secure routes.
  - Implementing token refresh mechanisms when the current token expires.
- **State Management with Context API**:
  - Storing and managing the **token** using `Context API` to ensure data security and session persistence.
- **Error Handling**: Managing login errors and providing user-friendly feedback through professional error handling techniques.
- **Building a Dashboard**:
  - Developing a control panel for managing user data after login.
  - Protecting the dashboard using **tokens** to prevent unauthorized access.
- **File Uploading and Data Deletion**:
  - Implementing image upload and sending files to the backend.
  - Managing add and delete operations smoothly and securely.

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Understanding how to verify user identity and assign permissions.
- **Security & Protection**: Securing the application and protecting sensitive data through the use of **tokens** and encryption techniques.
- **React Best Practices**: Learning how to properly use `useState` and `useEffect` to ensure a seamless user experience and optimal application performance.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: The core framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation and routing within the app.
- **Axios**: For sending and receiving data from the API.
- **Context API**: For managing the state of the **token** and user information across the app.

### Outcome:
This project lays the foundation for understanding how to build a secure and full-featured React application. It demonstrates handling authentication, protecting routes, and managing data interactions between the frontend and backend in a professional manner.
